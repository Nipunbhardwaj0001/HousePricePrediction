# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction Project 

This project aims to predict housing prices using machine learning techniques. It involves data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, all performed within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The core of the project revolves around analyzing housing data from CSV files to build a predictive model.

🚀 **Key Features**

*   **Data Loading & Handling:** Efficiently loads and manages housing data from CSV files using pandas DataFrames.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Provides comprehensive data visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to understand data distribution and relationships.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Implements data cleaning techniques, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
*   **Model Building & Training:** Develops and trains machine learning models to accurately predict house prices.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.

🛠️ **Tech Stack**

*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **Data Analysis & Manipulation:**
    *   pandas
    *   numpy
